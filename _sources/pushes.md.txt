# Session Push

Tarantool 1.10 introduced session pushes which gives an ability to receive
out of bound notifications from Tarantool server

For example let's consider this simple example:

```lua
function sub(n)
    for i=1,n do
        box.session.push(i, i * i)
    end

    return 'done'
end
```


This function will yield `n` push messages to the client before returning.
To receive such notification in Python using `asynctnt` we need to subscribe
first for these notifications and then use `PushIterator` to iterate over
all the messages from Tarantool:

```python
import asyncio
import asynctnt


async def main():
    async with asynctnt.Connection(port=3301) as conn:
        fut = conn.call('sub', [10], push_subscribe=True)
        it = asynctnt.PushIterator(fut)

        async for value in it:
            print(value)

asyncio.run(main())
```

This will produce the following output:

```bash
$ python example.py
[1, 1]
[2, 4]
[3, 9]
[4, 16]
[5, 25]
```


In order to receive a return value you can simply `await` on the initially
returned future from the `call()` method:

```python
import asyncio
import asynctnt


async def main():
    async with asynctnt.Connection(port=3301) as conn:
        fut = conn.call('sub', [10], push_subscribe=True)
        it = asynctnt.PushIterator(fut)

        async for value in it:
            print(value)

        print(await fut)  # receive the response

asyncio.run(main())
```
